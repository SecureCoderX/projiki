*The Project Manager Built for Developers Who Actually Code*

## Finally, a Project Manager That Gets It

You're tired of project management tools that feel like they were designed by committees who've never written a line of code. You need something that works the way your brain works‚Äîsometimes structured, sometimes chaotic, always creative.

**Projiki bridges the gap between rigid project management and the beautiful chaos of creative coding.**

## Two Modes, One Brain

### üèóÔ∏è Structured Developer Mode
When you need to ship, you need structure. Plan sprints, track tasks, visualize roadmaps. All the project management goodness without the enterprise bloat.

### üß† Vibe Coder Mode  
For those 2 AM breakthrough moments. Capture ideas instantly, save prompts that actually work, organize code snippets that you'll actually use again. Your creative flow, preserved.

**Switch between modes instantly.** Because real development isn't just one or the other‚Äîit's both.

## What Makes Projiki Different

**üéØ Built by Developers, for Developers**  
No more explaining why you need a "code snippet library" to your PM tool. Projiki speaks your language from day one.

**üíæ Your Data Stays Yours**  
Local-first means no cloud dependencies, no monthly subscriptions, no wondering if your brilliant 3 AM idea got lost in someone else's server farm.

**‚ö° Stupid Fast**  
Desktop app performance that doesn't make you wait. Because context switching is expensive enough without slow software.

**üåô Dark Mode by Default**  
Because we know what you prefer. Light mode available for those rare daylight hours.
